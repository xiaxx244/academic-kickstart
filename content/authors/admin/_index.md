Youya Xia is a first-year PhD student doing research about robotics, reinforcement learning and computer vision at Cornell University. She is currently working about improving the affective motion of Blossom using reinforcment learning techniques (e.g. off-policy actor critic algorithm). She earned her Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics in University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. When she was at UMN, She worked with Professor Junaed Sattar about underwater robotics, computer vision and robotics perception. Currently, her research interests lie in reinforcement learning, Meta-Learning, computer vision and robotics.
